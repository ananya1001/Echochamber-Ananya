# Echochamber-Ananya

Set up the coding environment using Google Colab.

I learnt Python- variables, data types, string operations, conditional statements, loops (for, while), functions, list/dictionary/tuple manipulations, and basic file input-output.

Learned about NumPy and understood array creation (1D, 2D), indexing/slicing, shape and reshape, broadcasting, vectorized operations, mathematical functions (mean, std, sum, etc.), and random number generation.

Studied Pandas and practiced creating and manipulating Series and DataFrames, selecting rows/columns, conditional filtering, handling missing data (isnull, dropna), reading from and writing to CSV files, and basic GroupBy operations.

For Matplotlib, I practiced plotting line graphs, bar charts, histograms, and pie charts. Learned to label axes, add legends, customize line styles/colors, and display multiple plots in one figure.

Used Pandas to clean and analyze data, then used Matplotlib to visualize insights through various types of plots. Focused on connecting data analysis with visual interpretation.

In week 2, I covered concepts like supervised learning, cost functions, gradient descent, overfitting vs underfitting, and evaluation metrics in Machine Learning.

Followed an Artificial Neural Networks playlist and learnt what perceptrons are, how neurons compute outputs, the role of activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh), forward propagation, and the intuition behind backpropagation.

Watched parts of the Recurrent Neural Networks playlist and understood the structure of RNNs, use cases in time-series and sequence modeling, issues like vanishing gradients, and how LSTMs and GRUs solve them.

So far, covered Python essentials, key data manipulation libraries (NumPy, Pandas), and data visualization (Matplotlib). Have a decent understanding of how data is processed and visualized before applying ML.

I gained initial theoretical knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, and am beginning to understand how models are built, trained, and optimized.
